This program converts UltiSnips (Vim) to Yasnippets (Emacs). 

* Usage 

An UltiSnips file can look like this (e.g. a part of my =tex.snippets=):
#+BEGIN_SRC 
snippet pdv "pdv" i
\pdv{$1}{$2}
endsnippet
                 
snippet dd "dd"
\dd{$1}
endsnippet
#+END_SRC

A yasnippet file =pdv= can look like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: pdv
# key: pdv
# --
\pdv{$1}{$2}
#+END_SRC

You can convert your UltiSnips to Yasnippets like this:  
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 convert_ultisnips_to_yasnippets.py tex.snippets
#+END_SRC
A new subdirectory is created called =converted= (by default), where you can find your yasnippet files.
